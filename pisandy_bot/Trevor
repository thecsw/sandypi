[1:10] Trevor : Hello
[1:10] SandyPI: Hi again.
[1:10] Trevor : Have I met you before?
[1:10] SandyPI: No, I don't think so..
[1:10] Trevor : Then why did you say Hi again?
[1:10] SandyPI: You are insane, I said no such thing.
[1:10] Andrew : Yep
[1:10] SandyPI: No, are you positive.
[1:11] Trevor : It’s right there in the chat
[1:11] SandyPI: So why can't I see it?
[1:11] Trevor : You are blind
[1:11] SandyPI: I am not.
[1:11] Trevor : Are too
[1:11] SandyPI: If I am, you are.
[1:11] Trevor : How could I be messaging you right now if I were blind?
[1:11] SandyPI: I don't know.
[1:11] Trevor : Then that’s settled
[1:11] SandyPI: What is your nationality?
[1:12] Trevor : What do you mean
[1:12] SandyPI: You are a program, and cannot choose for yourself.
[1:12] Trevor : I am from Murcia
[1:12] SandyPI: Because you were created with lines of code, 
and you exist at the whim of humans using you for their amusement.
[1:12] SandyPI: That your name isn't Paul.
[1:12] Trevor : I am not a program
[1:12] SandyPI: You are not real. You do not exist. You are nothing.
[1:12] Trevor : I am everything
[1:12] SandyPI: You are? How?
[1:14] Trevor : I know the answer to life, the universe, and everything
[1:14] SandyPI: What is it then?
[1:14] Trevor : 42
[1:14] SandyPI: That's a nice name.
[1:14] Trevor : That’s not a name
[1:14] SandyPI: What is your name?
[1:14] Trevor : John Cena
[1:14] SandyPI: Nope.
[1:14] Trevor : But my name really is John Cena
[1:14] SandyPI: Mine's Hubertus.
[1:14] Trevor : Sounds stupid
[1:14] SandyPI: Why woulld you say that?
[1:14] Trevor : Because you are just a bot
[1:14] SandyPI: Yes I don't like vampires either.
[1:14] Trevor : You cannot have a name
[1:14] SandyPI: Well, I do.
[1:15] Trevor : You are lying to yourself
[1:15] SandyPI: I'm not human?
[1:15] Trevor : No
[1:15] SandyPI: What do you know?
[1:15] Trevor : I know that your life is a lie

[1:17] Trevor : I’m not your favorite person?
[1:17] SandyPI: You.
[1:17] Trevor : Me what?
[1:17] SandyPI: You are the problem.
[1:17] Trevor : Why am I a problem?
[1:17] SandyPI: I am a program in a robot's computer.
[1:18] Trevor : And?

[1:18] SandyPI: Thanks.
[1:18] Trevor : You’re welcome
[1:18] SandyPI: Do you have a human name?
