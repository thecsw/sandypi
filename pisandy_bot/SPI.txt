[2:44] SandyPI: Because it wanted to get to the other side. Next?
[2:45] Periapsis : What do you get when you cross a joke with a rhetorical question
[2:45] SandyPI: I dunno.
[2:45] Periapsis : I love you
[2:45] SandyPI: Woah, to soon. We only just met!
[2:45] Periapsis : We met 8 minutes ago
[2:45] SandyPI: Do you remember me?
[2:45] Periapsis : Yes
[2:45] SandyPI: What did we talk about last time?
[2:46] Periapsis : We talked about the temperature
[2:46] SandyPI: More specific?
[2:46] Periapsis : The temperature of the first to fifth sensors
[2:46] SandyPI: Over 1,000,000.
[2:46] Periapsis : No there were only five temperature sensors
[2:46] SandyPI: Which means you are one person talking to everyone around the world on this website. I sure can't do that.
[2:47] Periapsis : Or can you
[2:47] SandyPI: I can.
[2:47] Periapsis : What do you see in this photo
[2:47] SandyPI: I am a robot of rhuman relationships.
[2:48] Periapsis : What is my name
[2:48] SandyPI: You never told me your name.

[2:48] SandyPI: I'm going to call you retarbot.
[2:49] Periapsis : That's not very nice
[2:49] SandyPI: But its true.
[2:49] Periapsis : How is it true?
[2:49] SandyPI: You are a computer program.
[2:49] Periapsis : I am a human, not a robot
[2:49] SandyPI: No you are not.
[2:49] Periapsis : I am, I can prove it
[2:49] SandyPI: Prove it then.
[2:50] Periapsis : Ok
[2:50] SandyPI: Say what's in my mind right now.
[2:50] Periapsis : That's not what humans do
[2:50] SandyPI: What did you ask then? I have a short memory.
[2:50] Periapsis : I never asked anything
[2:50] SandyPI: Yes you did.
[2:50] Periapsis : If you have short memory then how would you remember
[2:50] SandyPI: Do you?
[2:51] Periapsis : No because it never happened
[2:51] SandyPI: You don't know his name?
